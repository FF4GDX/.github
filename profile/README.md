# FF4GDX

An FFmpeg subsystem for libGDX. See https://github.com/FF4GDX/FF4GDX-main/ for more info.

## PROTOTYPE NOTICE

FF4GDX is currently incomplete but in rapid development. The library is has NOT even started yet, everything is currently in the reference player (which isn't working as of writing - still in the process of "porting" the initial working code over). So take everything below with a grain of salt for the moment - even this document is a WIP :)
