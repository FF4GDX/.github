# FF4GDX

FF4GDX is *not yet usable* - I am still in the process of bringing over my private working code into a nice, ready-to-use library.

All are still welcome to ask any questions, open issues or get in touch for whatever reason they like. I encourage all libGDX users to review my code and ask questions.
